# Attack Surface Mapping (ASM) Script

This repository contains a Bash script `asm.sh` designed to assist with Attack Surface Mapping (ASM) on target systems. This script automates reconnaissance processes and provides insights into exposed services, network configurations, and potential entry points.

## Features

- **Service Detection**: Identifies open ports and running services.
- **Network Mapping**: Maps network structure and identifies entry points.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Highlights potential vulnerabilities based on exposed services.
- **Report Generation**: Compiles results into a structured report.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu recommended)
- **Dependencies**: Ensure the following tools are installed:
  - `nmap`: For network scanning and service detection.
  - `curl` or `wget`: For retrieving external resources if required.
  - Other tools as specified in the script.

To install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nmap curl
